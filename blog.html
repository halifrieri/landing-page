                        <p>Hi!! I'm not quite sure who I'm addressing as the only people I can imagine reading this are friends, family, and mostly myself. But whoever sees this, I'm happy you're here! I hope you leave feeling even the tiniest bit more motivated to be creative. As a little girl, I often felt as though being "creative" meant nothing more than being given a filler compliment when you had no other easily identifiable or laudable traits. However, after graduating college and staring the rest of my life in the face, I've realized that you truly do live within the bounds of your mind and the broader your horizons, the more luscious green grass you have to roam. Of course having green grass is a function of actually watering it (aka having the discipline to be consistent). That's why I want to spend the next year of my life documenting my journey, challenging myself to do a creative act every day. I too often forget how lovely life is when I lose myself in the act of creation -- creating a TBR list to grow my bookshelf and vocabulary, mapping a new running route to find novel hills and views, curating a new playlist of songs that somehow captures the intangible essence of existing in a particular moment. I have to warn you that I intend most of my daily creative practices to be dedicated to improving my technical skills and becoming a better engineer/developer. I hope you stick around to play with the cool things I build! On that note, today's task is to build an AI ChatBot that mimics me. Currently unsure if I'll build my own LLM or just incorporate an already existing AI model but I'm sure I'll figure it out. Hopefully by the end of today you'll be able to click a button below to talk to "me" without actually talking to me. Ciao! </p>
