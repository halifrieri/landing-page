                        <p>Hi!! I'm not quite sure who I'm addressing as the only people I can imagine reading this are friends, family, and mostly myself. But whoever sees this, I'm happy you're here! I hope you leave feeling even the tiniest bit more motivated to be creative. As a little girl, I often felt as though being "creative" meant nothing more than being given a filler compliment when you had no other easily identifiable or laudable traits. However, after graduating college and staring the rest of my life in the face, I've realized that you truly do live within the bounds of your mind and the broader your horizons, the more luscious green grass you have to roam. Of course having green grass is a function of actually watering it (aka having the discipline to be consistent). That's why I want to spend the next year of my life documenting my journey, challenging myself to do a creative act every day. I too often forget how lovely life is when I lose myself in the act of creation -- creating a TBR list to grow my bookshelf and vocabulary, mapping a new running route to find novel hills and views, curating a new playlist of songs that somehow captures the intangible essence of existing in a particular moment. I have to warn you that I intend most of my daily creative practices to be dedicated to improving my technical skills and becoming a better engineer/developer. I hope you stick around to play with the cool things I build! On that note, today's task is to build an AI ChatBot that mimics me. Currently unsure if I'll build my own LLM or just incorporate an already existing AI model but I'm sure I'll figure it out. Hopefully by the end of today you'll be able to click a button below to talk to "me" without actually talking to me. Ciao! </p>

                        <p>Hello! I've finally deployed the backend in order to (officially) integrate the OpenAI API to the frontend of my chatbot using Heroku. The process was surprisingly not as bad as I was anticipating and I can't wait to continue deploying! AFter this I will finish the book I'm currently reading as I'm a tad behind on my September TBR. I couldn't help being overoptimistic about my reading speed when I created it as fall is the best reading season in my honest opinion. Feel free to tag along my journey to read 50 books by the end of 2024 on GoodReads!!</p>

                        <p>Howdy! As it turns out, deployment is still giving me some troubke thanks to the pesky venv, virtual environment, on my laptop confusing and interfering with my GitHub pages build. Not to fret, because this is just another learning opportunity and I think I've figured out how to fix it! On another note, I have a really exciting idea for a new project involving GoodReads and Spotify Wrapped. Since the planning and mapping of the website is still in the works I'll wait until tomorrow to explain my idea. In the meantime, I'll leave you with this thought-- Autumn is the best time to "fall" into reading and new music, whatever your tastes! It may not always be inviting to open up your literary and musical idiosyncrasies to others for criticism, but it can be a source of great introspection and laughs! In the spirit of sharing, my current read is Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte and my current song on repeat is "Our Day Will Come" by Amy Winehouse. Feel free to enjoy (or judge) my favorite songs of the month on Spotify!</p>
